# odin-recipes

## Greetings:

Hello and thank you for looking at my project. I am currently studying computer science at Ravensburg-Weingarten-University of applied sciences in Germany.

## What im trying to achieve:

This is an assignment from "The Odin Project" which im currently learning full stack web development with. The goal is to strengthen the basic HTML knowledge i have gained so far and putting it into practice (no CSS or Javascript at this point). I might add that style and functionality later, when i learned those languages. Additionally, this is the first time im trying to use git and gitHub for a full project from start to finish. I want to eventually add findings about what went wrong and what i would do differently the next time at the end of the file.

## Content outline:

Im trying to create a simple website for some of my favorite recipes with the following basic structure:

- a basic homepage with links to the sub pages containing the recipes
- images of the finished dishes
- a small list of ingredients for each recipe
- the instructions for cooking the dishes

## Learnings and findings along the way:

"none yet"
