    <h1>Smoked Salmon Sushi Roll</h1>
    <p>
      Homemade salmon roll made with sushi rice, nori, and smoked salmon. This
      is a very basic and easy recipe for making sushi. It might take a while to
      learn how to make a perfect roll, but you'll have fun trying! Add wasabi
      (Japanese horseradish) for a good kick!
